However, mining them can harm the environment.  What’s perhaps even more incredible is that these <strong>metals can be recycled almost infinitely.  <\/strong>Because metals don’t degrade, recycled gold or silver perform the same as newly mined – in fact, sometimes even better!  <\/p><p>The challenge is to find a balance between using these metals for clean energy and mining them responsibly.
